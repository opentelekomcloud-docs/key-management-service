Advantages
==========

Extensive Service Integration
-----------------------------

-  By integrating with OBS, EVS, and IMS, you can use KMS to manage the keys of the services or use KMS APIs to encrypt and decrypt local data.
-  By integrating with Cloud Trace Service (CTS), you can use CTS to view recent KMS operation records.

Regulatory Compliance
---------------------

Keys are generated by third-party validated HSMs. Access to keys is controlled and all operations involving keys are traceable by logs, compliant with international laws and regulations.

Easy to Use
-----------

You can use and manage keys easily using the console or APIs, needless to purchase hardware encryption devices.
