Encrypting Data in RDS
======================

-  When a user creates a database instance from Relational Database Service (RDS), the user can select **Disk encryption** and use the key provided by KMS to encrypt the disk of the database instance. For more information, see the *Relational Database Service User Guide*.

   You can use a custom key created on the KMS console for encryption.

-  You can also call the RDS APIs to purchase encrypted database instances. For details, see the *Relational Database Service User Guide*.
