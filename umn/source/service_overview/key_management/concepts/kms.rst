Key Management Service (KMS) is a secure, reliable, and easy-to-use service that helps users centrally manage and safeguard their Customer Master Keys (CMKs).

This service uses hardware security modules (HSMs) to protect CMKs. HSMs help you create and control CMKs with ease. All CMKs are protected by root keys in HSMs to avoid leakage caused by human error.

KMS implements access control and log-based tracking on all operations involving CMKs. Additionally, it provides use records of all CMKs, meeting your audit and regulatory compliance requirements.
