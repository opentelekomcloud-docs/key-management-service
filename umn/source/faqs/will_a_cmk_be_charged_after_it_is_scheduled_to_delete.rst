Will a CMK Be Charged After It Is Scheduled to Delete?
======================================================

No.

The pending period of a CMK from its scheduling till its deletion is not charged.

However, if you cancel the scheduled deletion, the charging resumes from the time when the CMK is scheduled to be deleted.
