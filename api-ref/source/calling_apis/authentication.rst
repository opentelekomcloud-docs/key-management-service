Authentication
==============

Requests for calling an API can be authenticated using either of the following methods:

-  Token-based authentication: Requests are authenticated using a token.
-  AK/SK-based authentication: Requests are authenticated by encrypting the request body using an AK/SK pair. This method is recommended because it provides higher security than token-based authentication.
